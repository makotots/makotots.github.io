[The Perl Conference](http://perlconference.us), formerly known as YAPC (Yet Another Perl Conference), has been the Perl conference of choice for over a decade.
â€‹
Hundreds of attendees come to hear over 100 talks across three days, but conferences as much social as technical, and as such have a very community-driven down to Earth feel that make them a joy to attend. As with all the best conferences the "hallway track", birds of a feather sessions (BOFs), and the people you meet are the reason most attendees come back year after year.

# 2020

While COVID-19 has kept us at home, the 2020 conference will be hosted online. Check out The Perl Conference website for more details.
