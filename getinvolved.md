The Perl Foundation exists to promote and support community efforts around the Perl programming language. We encourage you to contribute by:

- Joining your local Perl Mongers group
- Visit PerlMonks
- Attend a YAPC in your region of the world
- There are many other ways you can contribute to Perl, including:
  - Contribute and maintain a module on the CPAN
  - Participate in the development, maintenance and documentation of Perl 5 and Raku.
  - â€‹Another important way you can contribute to Perl, both as a language and as a community, is to make a tax-deductible donation to the Perl Foundation.
